For this homework and on, please exercise preventative programming where you make no assumptions about the format of the input. Your functions need to be able to handle any kind of input users may provide, including but not limited to empty input, input of an unexpected type, etc. Furthermore, your functions need to work for any input, beyond the sample input and output provided in the directions of each question. For example, do not assume lists that users give you are always sorted. 

Good luck, have fun, Minghao and Rio are available via Slack and after class in office hours Tuesdays and Thursdays
